## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
countdown <- 10

while (countdown > 0) {
  cat(countdown, "...\n")
  Sys.sleep(1)  
  countdown <- countdown - 1
}

cat("Blastoff!\n")
```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
word <- readline("Enter a word: ")

index <- nchar(word)

reversed_word <- ""

while (index > 0) {
  char <- substr(word, index, index)
  reversed_word <- paste0(reversed_word, char)
  index <- index - 1
}

cat("Reversed word:", reversed_word, "\n")
```
